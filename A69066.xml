            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe gloriouſe Apoſtle Saint PETER very fittely compareth the worde of God,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1, 19.</note> and the doctrine of the holy-Ghoſt, <q>vnto a Candell ſhining in a darke place, vntill the day dawne, and the day ſtarre ariſe in our hartes.</q> For although Chriſt our Sauiour the true light of the worlde, hath by his moſt bitter Paſſion and pretiouſe woundes giuen light vnto our darkenes; yea, and of darkenes which we were before, made vs a ſhining light: yet ſo long as we remaine in the miſt of this mortalitie, and that it appeareth not what we ſhal be: we are truely light in compariſon of Heretickes and Infidells: but in reſpect of heauen; we are in the night, and continually conuerſe in obſcurity and darkenes. All honour then and glory be (as it is worthy) yeelded vnto him, who leaſt we walking in darkenes know not whither to goe, hath prouided vs a Candell of his holy doctrine euen in the middeſt of Egypt, and ſet it vpon a candleſticke in the Catholicke Church: where thoſe which are out of this houſe of God liuing in palpable darkenes; the children of this light may ſafely expecte the riſing of that ſtarre, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall ſette, which is the cleare viſion of Gods euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory. This light although by diuerſe perſons who loue darkenes better than light, it hath by ſundry meanes bene aſſaulted: yet hath theſe aſſaultes done nothing e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe, but by encreaſing the aduerſe darkenes, made the light appeare more gloriouſe: and contrary to mans expectation, yet agreeably to Gods diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not brought water to quench, but fewell to feede ſo liuely ſlames. Hence may we in all places of our Countrey to our owne great comforte, and Gods ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular glory, out of Priſons, out of Iudgementes, out of all maner of publicke places, out of many priuate
<pb facs="tcp:7960:3"/> perſons and families, behold the beames of this light ſo vehemently iſſuing forth;<note place="margin">Mat. 24, 27.</note> that comming out of the Eaſt (for to vſe our Sauiours wordes) it appeareth euen to the Weſt: and it ſhineth ſo generally abroade, that it is renowmed in the wholle world: which ſeeing the beauty thereof, glorifieth our Father of light which is in heauen.</p>
            <p>Onely (my deare Catholicke Brother) who being vnlearned ſeekeſt to treade the ſteppes of thy forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; walking in darkenes of this mortall life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt to follow thoſe which bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We are not ignorant of his cogitations, who like a roaring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goeth about ſeeking whom he may deuour: and amongſt other ſleightes which he vſeth, transfiguring himſelfe into an Angell of light, with a counterfaite light of hypocriſy and hereſy; ſeeketh to depriue thee of that which is true and ſincere.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7960:3"/> other partes of the world. This when thou haſt once receiued, and fully enioied, thy ſelfe: thinke that thou haſt not performed thy duety, if thou imparte it not to thy children. O how they are deceiued, &amp; in how great daunger of euerlaſting damnation doe they liue, who as though they had by carnall generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought into this world brute beaſtes, whoſe onely end is to liue here, without any end of heauenly bliſſe: do not ſeeke for their children the meanes of their ſaluation, onely prouiding for them earthly riches, not caring for heauenly. Nor conſidering, that beſides the very bonde of the lawe of nature, &amp; of God himſelfe, who hath giuen moſt ſtraite charge of good education of children: Chriſt our Sauiour hath conſecrated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian mariages into a ſacrament, for this end amongſt others; that they may preſent vnto our Sauiour ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied children by baptiſme firſt, and afterward by all Chriſtian and Catholike diſcipline. Mariage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to propagate the people of God, not to build vp the confuſed walles of Babilon. The Turke or Iew if he ſhould perceiue his child to haue bene preſent at Chriſtian Ceremonies, would not ſticke to embrew his handes in that which he begotte. And yet he w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> profeſſeth himſelfe a Catholicke, by ſending his child, or permitting his childe to be ſent to ſuch thinges as are indiſpenſably forbidden by God himſelfe: doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally depriue his innocent ſonne of that which he coulde not giue him. But true it is which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaide:<note place="margin">Luc 16, 8.</note> that wiſer are the children of this worlde in their generation, than the children of lighte. But thou deare Brother, when thou falleſt into any ſuch preuarication, thinke aſſuredly that thy light is bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come darkenes. And that in darkenes thou ſhalte ſo
<pb facs="tcp:7960:4"/> long remaine, vntill thou take away the buſhell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou haſt ſette before others eies: and permit the light to ſhine to all thoſe of whom thou haſt charge.</p>
            <p>But to the intent that thou maieſt not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duety, which is neceſſarily &amp; vpon paine of vtter darkenes required of thee: but alſo like vnto a childe of lighte ſeeke that which is perfect, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of light liberally endeuour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which thou haſt thy ſelfe of God receiued: I haue ſet downe in the margen of this booke, all thoſe places of holy Fathers and Scriptures which are in the Lattin: to the intent that thou either being aſſaulted by any aduerſary, or thy ſelfe ſeeking to reſchew out of miſerable captiuitie any ſoule: mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt haue authorities to alleage for whatſoeuer thou ſhalt ſay. Of the places of ſcripture for the moſt parte I haue quoted the very verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſodainely thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt find that wherin conſiſteth the force of the proofe.</p>
            <p>Finally I haue added certaine little Kindled ſizes, to lighten ſome ſecrete corners which might otherwiſe annoy thee. All which God graunt that it may to his glory both maintaine and increaſe the light of thy hart, and bring forth in many obſcure mindes ſuch brightnes of true beliefe, that wee all may worthely walke by the ſame, conforming our liues thereunto. That ſo being made worthy vnto the parte of the loue of the Saints,<note place="margin">Col. 1, 13.</note> in the light; we may by him which hath deliuered vs from the power of darkenes, be tranſlated at the length into the euerlaſting Kingdome of the ſonne of his loue: where we ſhall not onely neede neither ſunne nor moone: but we ſhal receiue that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte light of the Lambe, by whome onely as we haue bene redeemed, ſo muſt we alſo be glorified.</p>

The firſt is the very naked &amp; ſincere truth very plainly &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſly ſet downe. The ſecond is the multitude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of her ſinceritie. For the innocency of truth is ſuch, that it preſently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth it ſelfe vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder and diſcouereth all malicious ſlaunders; which when they growe vnto moſt intollerable impudency, cannot yet abide the force and maieſty of ſo vnſpotted teſtimonies, againſt which there cannot be taken any exception. This whereas I my ſelfe haue founde in the peruſing of this worke, I could not but imparte vnto thee my minde and iudgemente. Fare-well.</p>

For many ſhall you finde, of al ſortes of calling, (though thankes be to God not of the ciuileſt conditions) who
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:7960:277"/> will not ſticke conſtantly to affirme that their forfathers kneeling, and knocking their breaſtes, and vſing othet laudable acts of deuotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Images at holy places: did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thinke that thoſe Images were Gods, &amp; did abſolutely powre out their praiers vnto the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. A thing, in my opinion, that argueth in thoſe which auouche it, a want not onely of piety, but of all ciuility. For if one called the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of theſe men Theeues; or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcioners, or of vile and baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, voide of Gentry &amp; Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: then woulde they ſtorme and rage, and repute it an intollerable iniury. And yet both they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues will reſolutely thinke, and giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leaue to ſuppoſe and ſaie the ſame, that theire forefathers were Fooles, and depriued of common ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding, which were
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:7960:278"/> as much as to call them Beaſtes in humane ſhape and figure. And ſurely to thruſte their aunceſtours out of Heauen (as they muſt needs, if they think them Idolatours) were ſomewhat excuſable: becauſe God wil haue mercy on whom he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good, and giueth Heauen to a fewe whome he hath ſpecially cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: but to expell them from the participation of a common vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby only man diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beaſts; is a thing altogither intolerable, and a woonder, which none but vnkind Heretickes<note n="*" place="margin">2.

               <p>And to worſhippe Idolles, &amp; to repute Creatures as Gods, when the faith of one God which made Heauen and Earth, &amp; the tidings of the Goſpel was neuer heard of: (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though among the wiſer ſorte of

Firſt as it is a part of the Saint: And ſo, it deſerueth honor indeed, as hath beene ſhewed before: but leſſe than the Sainte himſelfe; for that the whole is more perfect than one part alone. And that which we haue ſaide of the part of the bodie, or of the wholle bodie, which is a part of the wholle man: is alſo to bee vnderſtoode of ſuch exteriour thinges as<note n="*" place="margin">Vide 8.

And ſurely if a king could, when he would, leaue off his hande, &amp; ſende it to his ſubiects abroade: no doubt but with great reuerence it woulde be euerie where receiued: eſpeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if thoſe which reuerenced the hand did knowe that the King did ſee them, and beholde their dutifull ſhewes of loyall affection. Nowe certaine it is that the Saints doe ſee our reuerende behauiour to their
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:7960:282"/> Relickes, and as for their bodies &amp; partes thereof: we are aſſured that nowe they be theirs, and their ſoule hath a natural reſpect vnto them, &amp; ſhall one day receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glorified.</p>
               <p>Secondly wee may conſider the Relickes, whatſoeuer they bee, as they doe repreſent<note n="*" place="margin">Chryſ. in l. de S. Babyl.</note> vnto vs the wholle Saint, and are as it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Images of him. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte wee muſt ſay the ſame which we generally hold of images: which here I purpoſe briefly to ſet downe.</p>
               <p>Knowe thou therefore that an Image is honourable two waies.<note place="margin">Images are honourable two waies.</note> Firſt when wee ſtay in the Image it ſelfe, conſidering it as a venerable thing for the ſimilitude which it hath with the Saint, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of it, and dedication to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vſe. After which manner wee alſo yeeld a certaine holineſſe vnto the holy BIBLE, &amp; ſacred CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICES,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:7960:283"/> and other holy thinges in the Church. So was it defined in the ſeuenth general Councel holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at<note n="*" place="margin">Actione. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Nice.</hi> And in this ſenſe though the Church doth yeelde reuerence vnto Images, and that for the Saint his ſake: yet the ordinary worſhip &amp; deuotion vſed vnto them by the faithfull people, is not in this onely reſpecte exhibited and ſhewed. For when we kneele &amp; pray before an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of any Saint: we inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reuerence a thing for his ſake: But our meaning is, to yeelde ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; to make our prayer vnto the Sainte himſelfe, not ſtaying in the Image alone. And this is the ſecond way of honoring an Image. That is, when that which we do, we do not for to ſtay in the Image, but in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage &amp; by the Image we do it vnto him which is ſignified in the ſame. In the firſt we immediately honour
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:7960:283"/> the Image, yet for the Saint himſelf: in the ſecond, we immediately ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the Saint by the Image &amp; in the Image, without giuing any honour vnto the Image it ſelfe, but only an accidentarie kind of honour. Euen as hee which honoureth the King, honoureth his apparell and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer belongeth vnto him, but onlie accidentarilye: becauſe hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely to honour the perſon of the King. The reaſon of this is: for that although I cannot thinke of the Image as it is an Image, but I muſt needes thinke of that whoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage it is: yet thinking of both, I may honour one only actually and expreſſely: though virtually &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it redound to the honour of the other, as hath beene ſaide.</p>
               <p>Three examples will I giue thee of this wholle matter. Thou ſeeſt in a glaſſe thy owne face: and yet
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:7960:284"/> yet thy face is not in the glaſſe, but only an Image of thy face: and yet maieſt thou truely ſay thou ſeeſt thy face, becauſe the Image is that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by which thou ſeeſt thy face, and cannot properly be ſaid to bee that which is ſeene it ſelfe, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers teach:<note place="margin">3. Deanima</note> but that by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing is ſeene. Likewiſe as the Philoſophers alſo affirme: it is neceſſarie that euerie one whileſt he vnderſtandeth in this life: forme him ſelfe a phantaſie or likeneſſe of that thing which he vnderſtandeth in his imagination. Now when thou in thy chamber where thou haſt no Image, lifteſt vp thy harte to CHRIST in heauen, and frameſt a likeneſſe of him in thy minde, and worſhippeſt him, and praieſt vnto him: thou wilt not ſay for feare of Idolatry (if thou arte a Proteſtant) that thou honoureſt that likeneſſe
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:7960:284"/> which thou haſt in thy braine: for that were to make to thy ſelfe a God of a phantaſie: but by that likeneſſe, and in that likeneſſe, thou honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the true God. So is it, and no otherwiſe in our Images: which helpe vs to doe that which our own imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needs doe, though not ſo perfectly without the Image. Thirdly thou honoureſt the King whom thou ſeeſt in his apparell: ſo maieſt thou conceiue that the Saint is in a maner cladde in the Image, and ſo pray vnto him, conceiuing him as preſent, though he be not in deede but onely by his vertue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God. Finally, if thou wilt haue one example to declare vnto thee both kind of honours due vnto an Image: that is, both becauſe it is an Image like vnto the Sainte; and becauſe in it and by it thou honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the Sainte: the like diſtinction

                  <pb n="548" facs="tcp:7960:286"/> maieſt thou behold in an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of a forren Prince.

Euen ſo doth an Image, ſometime actually repreſent the Sainte: and when it doth not, it is alwaies a reuerende Image, naturally able to doe the ſame, and by the Church deputed to that end: &amp; therefore more than ordinary wood, paper, and ſtone.</p>
               <p>And all this honour which wee haue ſpoken of, is ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:7960:286"/> the honour due vnuo God, that it doth the more increaſe and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it. Which<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. cont.

               <p>I find in auncient times, offerings to haue been taken two waies. Firſt, euery thing which was charitablely giuen vnto the Miniſters of God, or to his people, was called an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Secondly, there were certaine thinges religiouſlye offered in the Church at the AVL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAR for the cauſes a fore-ſaide: that is, for the ſuſtenance of the poore,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:7960:296"/> or of the Miniſters of the Church, or to bee applied to other Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endes, according to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Biſhoppe. So in the Canons of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Cap. 3. &amp; 6. Synod. c. 28.</note> the Apoſtles are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted offerings at the AVLTAR of newe Corne, and newe Grapes.

And that wee may knowe that theſe Almes were offered not onelie in the Church, but alſo at the AVLTAR: hee maketh mention in an other place of certaine women taken<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ep. 122. ad Victor.</note> captiues, whom he pitieth the more becauſe, they could not cary theire offring to the Aultar, being among Infidells.

The ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the offering? but that doth putte vs in mind to whom we doe it, rectifie our intention, edifie the wholle congregation, and honour Almightie GOD.

For certain it is that we may honor God although wee worke. And ſo we ſee among Chriſtians that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony not to be kept in ſuch rigour as it was by the <hi>Iewes:</hi> becauſe the Church renuing that ceremonie, onely forbiddeth ſeruile works, but not trauailing nor riding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not the labour of beaſtes and ſuch like.</p>

Such are not kneling in praier, lifting vp of hands or eies, knocking of the breaſts, and finallye that which wee ſpoke of, Voweing &amp; Offering.

               <p>Lette it therefore remaine, that theſe things aboue ſpoken of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ceremonies but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al true Religions of all ages: &amp; if they had bene <hi>Iewiſh;</hi> yet might they hauing no neceſſarie ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our redemption as to come;

               <p>So CANDELS burning in the Church, euen in the day-time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the Goſpel, doe ſignifie the light of the Goſpell<note n="(a)" place="margin">Io. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

So may wee diſcourſe of other holye ceremonies vſed in Gods Church. And it is no maruell though in our ſtate we haue ſome figure of things to come. For<note n="(c)" place="margin">1.

Wherefore Chriſt himſelfe by his reſt in the Sepvlcher, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt of Heauen: &amp; although

Now S. <hi>Hierome</hi> aunſwereth it ſo, that wee may perceiue that his opinion was that Candels were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſette before Relickes but in the night, when the people were come togither to watche at the memories of Saintes, vpon their Eues. And that then it was only doone for that neceſſity, not for any honour to the
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:7960:317"/> Sainte. Not that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> did not acknowledge honour to be due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Relickes, for as we haue ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: in this very booke againſt <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> he conſtantly auoucheth it: but becauſe he had not as yet beene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant in places where this kind of honour was ſhewed vnto the Saintes. For if hee had euer ſeene it vſed in the day: than muſt it needes haue beene for a ſigne of ioy &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Saintes, which he heere denieth to haue beene the intent of the Church. Yet that this cuſtome was in other partes of the world, far from S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> as in SPAINE &amp; FRANCE, where <hi>Vigilantius</hi> liued: we may gather manifeſtly, both by his obiection, &amp; out of others who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we will alleadge. Yea S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelfe, although he ſeeme not to acknoweledge any general cuſtome of the Church in this pointe: yet
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:7960:317"/> doth he commend the zeale of who ſoeuer might perchaunce in ſome place vſe the ſame, euen to honour Saintes thereby; comparing their deuotion to that of MARY MAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DALEN, when ſhee powred the ointmente vpon our Sauiour, and was by him defended from <hi>Iudas</hi> his hipocriſie. <hi>So whoſoeuer doth light torches</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath a reward accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his faith. Whereas the Apoſtle ſaith: Let euery one abounde in his owne ſenſe. Theſe men dost thou call Idolaters? We al</hi> (I confeſſe) <hi>which doe beleeue in Christ, came forth of the error of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. For we are not made Christians by birth, but by regeneration. And becauſe we once worſhipped Idolles, must we not nowe worſhippe God, least we may ſeeme to worſhip him with the like honor with which we worſhiped Idolles? That was doone vnto the Idols, and therefore muſt bee deteſted: this is doone to Martyrs,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:7960:318"/> and therefore must be admitted. For euen where there are no Relickes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, in all the East-Churches, when the Goſpell is to be read, Lights are kindled, euen the Sunne ſhining, not to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way darkeneſse, but to ſhewe a token of ioy.

As therefore in the relickes and inſtrumentes of the paſſions of Saints we ſee certain particular and determinate thinges brought to paſſe: ſo alſo may wee

               <p>And to conclude all this with an inuincible argument: let our Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes yeeld me a reaſon, wherefore to the Princes<note n="(o)" place="margin">Pollyd. l. 8. hiſtor.</note> of our countrey as an hereditary power from S. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> hath bin graunted this gifte of curing one particuler diſeaſe more

And all this is ſo neceſſarie for remiſſion of ſinnes; that if there want but one of them, either ſorrowe, or purpoſe, or due examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or pure Confeſſion, or fulfilling the Penance enioined, or at the leaſt in the three laſt a full intent to execute them in due time: no man can obtaine the grace of God, much leſſe ſuch Pardons as we ſpeake of, which are not nor can be imparted, but to thoſe onely, which are in Gods bleſſed fauour. Nowe if there happen any opportunity of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or remiſſion of this Penance enioined, or of that which by the auncient Canons of the Church, or by Gods ſecrete &amp; moſt iuſt iudgement ſhould in rigour bee inioined: (for ordinarily the Penance in our age enioined in Confeſſion, is not equall vnto that, which the auncient Canons of the Church, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Gods own determination hath allotted:) than ſixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is required the fulfilling of that worke vnto which the Indulgence is annexed. And ſo, if the partie which ſeeketh the Indulgence be ſtill in grace, and the cauſe proportionable to the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: infallibly he receiueth the ſame. And yet ſome Diuines, doe vpon probable groundes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:7960:335"/> that he which will obtaine an Indulgence, muſt beſides all this, of neceſſitie either haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of his Ghoſtly-father, or purpoſed to take vpon himſelfe ſo greate penance, as were in it ſelfe ſufficient to ſatisfie for that paine, which in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence is remitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at the leaſt that he muſt haue a generall purpoſe to ſatisfie Gods Iuſtice in this life, by Godly workes and deuout labours and ſufferings: otherwiſe, except the worke exacted in the Indulgence be equiualent to the paine remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: he ſhall not enioy the benefitte. Their reaſon is, for that he which hath not this minde, as much as in himſelfe lieth, to procure his owne ſuccours for his negligence, coldeneſſe, and ſlackeneſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth not helpe of others: and it ſeemeth (as they ſay) that Chriſt &amp; his Saintes intended not to yeeld ſuch vnneceſſary helpe, whereby negligence might be increaſed. But this opinion is by others worthily reiected. Who ſay, that if the Penitent haue this full conditionall reſolution, to fulfill his enioined Penance in Confeſſion, if he cannot obtaine by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence the remiſſion therof: whether his Penance were great or little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſhall he not beeing a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly member of CHRIST be depriued of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the common treaſure of his wholle body,<note place="margin">A Purpoſe of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for him which will receiue an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> and conſequently of ſuch Indulgence.

               <p>THis therefore being the courſe of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in obtaining Pardon of ſinnes: let vs on the contrary ſide, examine a little howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe things are to be found in the Proteſtants Pardons. For that they haue Pardons; yea &amp; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Indulgences alſo, none can doubte, who heareth euery day that they are cleanſed &amp; purged from all ſinne, and ſure to goe to Heauen, ſo ſoone as they ſhall die. For in very deede, this is not only a full remiſſion of all paines and puniſhmentes, but alſo a moſt certaine aſſurance of that ſingular gifte of God, which is perſeuerance to the ende. Which if the Catholicke could perſwade himſelfe ſo eaſelye to be gotten: he would with S. Paul<note n="*" place="margin">1.

But whereas they doe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly and contemptuouſly obiect vnto vs the Popes Pardons, giuing the people to vnderſtand that the Pope graunteth leaue to ſinne before-hand and too eaſely remitteth that which he ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſh and that which is a horrible blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that he doth make by his Pardons any thing lawfull vnto vs, be it in it ſelfe neuer ſo repugnant to Gods holy commandementes: Let vs compare our pardons with theirs, our Iubeleis with theirs, our remiſſions with theirs.</p>
               <pb n="642" facs="tcp:7960:336"/>
               <p>And to beginne firſt with Confeſſion; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knowen in their iudgement for the moſte parte to be accounted a thing little agreable with nature it ſelfe, how many ſinfull thoughtes doe they harbour, how many ſhamefull blaſphemous, and iniurious wordes doe they vtter (alwaies excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome fewe of more ciuill and naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) How many brutiſh actes doe they commit: which they would neuer fall into, or at the leaſt they would auoide in parte: if beſides the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God before which all hidden thinges of darkeneſſe ſhall be lightened,<note place="margin">1.

I my ſelfe when I liued in my owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, haue had ſufficient experience of diuers: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither loue of the worlde, could with-hold: nor cuſtome of ſinne allure: nor feare of lawes keepe backe: &amp; yet the onely ſhame of Confeſſion could, &amp; as I thinke, doth as yet detaine from the vnitie of the Catholicke Church: &amp; as our vnderſtanding is often blinded by an infected wil, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to acknowledge in hart, that which is the onely truth.</p>
               <p>Let vs then goe to another condition; And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their auſtere kind of life, &amp; ſtrict ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Almightie God. And as for Faſting: what better ſigne of a good Proteſtant then to eate fleſh on the Friday, without iudging betweene day and day? For Almes: if we mighte haue the Voices of all thoſe which are poore &amp; needie in our Countrey, in whom this gloriouſe vertue doth more ſhine, whether in Catholickes or in Proteſtants: it would
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:7960:336"/> ſoone appeare what incomparable difference there is. But for Praier: I appeale to all greate houſe keepers, or thoſe which are the generall harbourers of all ſortes of men: yea and vnto all other perſons who conuerſe indifferentlye abroade: whether if a man be not otherwiſe knowen to be a Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it be not a manfeſt probability of a Papiſt, to ſay his praiers deuoutly vpon his knees at his bedd-ſid, either morning or euening. Sure I am that there be many honeſt matrons and diuerſe ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt the Proteſtants, who after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of CORNELIVS<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 10, 2.</note> endeuour according to their knowledge, to ſerue Almightie God, and to attend to workes of Charitie and Prayer: whom I hope GOD doth now diſpoſe by little and little with his preuenting-grace, to receiue one day a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte knowledge of his will, when they may by his cooperating-grace, with ſuch good workes builde vnto euerlaſting ſaluation, which in their preſent eſtate<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11, 6. Rom. 14, 23</note> they cannot. But euen theſe doe I call to witneſſe, earneſtly intreating them for the honor of God, &amp; without all vaine-glory (as they haue little cauſe therof) to ſhewe howe many examples they haue ſeene of the like deuotions.</p>
               <p>Then let vs examine whether at the leaſt there be to be found ſome great cauſe of Pardon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which we propounded in the ſixt place, as neceſſarie in our remiſſions. And perhappes wee ſhal find ſome building of Hoſpitals: ſome erecting of Churches: ſome enterpriſe againſt the Turkes, the enemies of Chriſt, and of Chriſtendome: ſome ſolemne and generall praier for the neceſſities of the Church: which are the cauſes ordinarily pretended
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:7960:337"/> in our Indulgences. But on our aduerſaries ſide howe the matter doth ſtand, the miſerable ruines of antiquities doe ſhewe: their rauenous gaping after Eccleſiaſticall goodes doe teſtifie: their intolerable vexations of their poore neighbours doe crie<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 22, 23.</note> vp to Heauen. But theſe be outwarde thinges, Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Penance, Workes of Deuotion. It may be that the intenall things, as Sorrowe, purpoſe of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſeuere examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Actions, Words, and Thoughts, doe ſo much excell; that there can be no neede of thoſe outwarde Ceremonies. Eſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whereas now the time is come when we muſt ſerue God in ſpirite and trueth. And yet there is nothing leſſe. For howe can they ſettle themſelues to the particular ſearche of their ſinnes, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe to Confeſſe them particularly to the Prieſt, God knowing them already more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly than themſelues: and beſides (if they ſtande to their Maiſters doctrine) maintaine that al our works are ſins, if God ſtraitly examine them? So that if this be credited, they need not ſeeke to ſort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good deeds from the badde. But for purpoſe of keeping Gods Commaundementes: they ſhoulde highly deceiue themſelues, if euer they ſhould make it. For they holde it an impoſſible thing, to obſerue the ſame. And as for ſorrowe, that they thinke not neceſſary. For that METANOIA, which they cannot deny, becauſe it is ſo often commended vnto vs in the Scriptures: they will not haue to ſignifie a ſorrowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full repentance,<note place="margin">Beza vpon Mat. 3. and Luther. ſer. de poenit.</note> but a RESIPISCENCE, or waxing wiſe againe (which God graunt they may doe) without any ſorrowe, or affliction of minde for that which is paſt. And although ſome of their
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:7960:337"/> Doctours doe require ſuch ſorrowe: yet, neither will they haue it the cauſe of remiſſion of ſinnes, nor neceſſary for ſuch effecte. But onely they require Faith as a neceſſary, &amp; ſufficient cauſe, after which as they moſt abſurdly ſay, by a neceſſary ſequell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth this ſorrowe, euen whether wee will or no. And yet here muſt I needes craue pardon, if I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are alſo voide of Faith. For there can be but one<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 4, 5.

PAVL<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11, 4.</note> ſaith, which, although they brag neuer ſo much of their Iuſtification by Faith, ſo long as in any one thing they diſſent from the Church, they cannot haue. Wherefore although I might ſay that they require nothing at all for their iuſtification, becauſe they cannot (beeing as they are) haue ſo much as Faith, the beginning &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all diſpoſition thereunto: yet ſuppoſing that they were in the right Faith: conſider good Reader, who forgiueth ſinnes more eaſily: The POPE, or Caluin?

               <p>FOr whereas they doe ſo wickedly ſlaunder the Paſtours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, as if they did graunt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to licence men to ſinne, &amp; to diſpenſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in Gods commaundements: it is a thing which neuer any CATHOLICKE did yeelde, nor euer anie POPE did challenge to himſelfe, but alwaies acknowledged that euery ſimple Prieſt might to thoſe which are his ſubiects, remit the mortal ſinnes themſelues, although not the temporall puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, in as high and ample manner as hee himſelfe, he hauing no authority to remitte out of Sacramentes any one mortall ſinne in the worlde.

Let them turne ouer al our Bookes, our Schoolemen, our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſtes, and Summiſtes, and if they finde in anie one Author of credite that all the thinges aboue mentioned muſt not of neceſſitie concurre: and ſo hath alwaies bene vnderſtood in the practiſe of the Church after the maner by vs declared: they ſhall recouer their creditte, of true and honeſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

               <p n="6">6 Why Pardons are called remiſsions of ſinnes, whereas they take away the puniſhment onely.</p>
               <p>BVt it may peraduenture ſomewhat moue our aduerſaries, that we call theſe Indulgences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of ſinnes, whereupon it ſeemteh we

But this we can eaſely declare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an example of a Father, who although he haue receiued into fauour his ſonne whom he had diſinherited, which is to remitte him his fault, and to receiue him into his grace: yet doth he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe oftentimes ſome lighter puniſhment for the ſame faulte, both as a cautell for that which is to come, and as a iuſt reuenge for the offence remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then he may iuſtly be ſaide not to haue perfectly forgiuen his ſonnes faulte. So alſo doth the holy Scriptures call the guilte of puniſhment by the name of ſinne.<note place="margin">Gen. 43, 8.</note> Vnleſſe I ſhall (ſaith IVDAS to IACOB) bring againe the childe: I will be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a ſinne vnto thee all my life.

And by mercy and verity, iniquitie is redeemed. And although ſometimes in Pardons it be ſaid A CVL<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>PA &amp; POENA:<note place="margin">What theſe wordes A Culpa &amp; Poena ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</note> From the fault and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the true meaning of the Church therein is: that the fault muſt be remitted, either before the ſeeking of the Indulgence: or elſe in the very worke which is the cauſe of the Indulgence: when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is exacted for obtaining the ſame. Or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by Contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worke is performed in grace: ſo that there is giuen both togither:<note place="margin">Whether all the workes for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence muſt be donne in grace.</note> yet by diuerſe cauſes. The firſt, by Confeſſion, or Contrition: the ſecond, by the Indulgence. For although it be not neceſſary, that for to obtaine an Indulgence al the works which are done for the ſame, be done in Gods grace: yet is it verie neceſſary that all thoſe workes be throughly done, and that the laſt worke
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:7960:339"/> of all in which the Pardon is to be receiued, be not onely done with a certaine morall perferction, but alſo in the grace &amp; fauour of God. For example: There is a Iubiley, in which it is graunted that who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer Faſteth three daies, and giueth Almes, and ſuch a day viſiteth ſuch a Church praying for ſome particuler neceſſities, ſhall haue a plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Although a man doe the other in ſtate of mortall ſinne, yet if hee for the ſame good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe throughly performe them, and then hauing by the ordinary meanes obtained Gods grace, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitte the Church: he ſhall receiue the Indulgence: and yet if the POPE ſhould ſo graunt it, that he muſt firſt Confeſſe, and then Faſt, and giue Almes, and viſitte the Church: then would I thinke that his intention were, to haue al the thinges following performed in grace: &amp; ſo if he fall in the midſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weeke ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he faſt not in grace: he getteth nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Of diuerſe kinds of Indulgences.</p>
               <p>FOr the better declaration of the cuſtome of the Church in this matter of Indulgences: it is to be vnderſtoode, that wee may diuide Pardons two manner of waies. Firſt, in reſpecte of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the puniſhement releaſed: Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of the quantitie of the ſame puniſhment taken away.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment it ſelfe ſometimes is enioined in Penance by the Ghoſtly-Father: ſometimes it is due either by the Canons of the Church, allotting certaine Penances for euery faulte; or in the ſtricte examination of Gods iuſt iudgement, who onely ſearcheth the hart, and knoweth the depth of our
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:7960:340"/> deſertes. From all theſe kindes may the Church abſolue, for that ſoueraigne autority which it hath recriued, as we haue partly ſhewed aboue, &amp; ſhall more exactly be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pardon of Penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined, &amp; of other paines alſo.</note>And heerein is founded the firſt diuiſion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, into remiſſion of Penance enioined: and of penance which is in the ſight of God due. Where we muſt alſo note, that vnleſſe it be ſpecified in the Bull, or graunt of the Indulgence, that it is only of Penance enioined: it is to be vnderſtood of al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Penance.<note place="margin">Pardons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of Pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce enioined, is neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, but when it is ſo ſpecified.</note> And when it is ſo ſpecified: then doth the Indulgence nothing profitte him w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hath no Penance enioined. Wherefore for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Pardons: it is very good in this reſpecte to demaund of the Confeſſour ſo much extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Penance as may bee taken away by the ſame: intending to fulfill the Penance in deede, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe thereof bee not obtained. And the greater the Penance is, either in continuance, or in ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the more puniſhment is releaſed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thereof. As if the Pardon bee of ſeauen yeares of enioined Penance: euen as more ſatisfaction is made by faſting thriſe a weeke for that time, than by once a weeke: ſo the Pardon of the firſt, is more auaileable than of the ſecond.<note place="margin">It is good alwaies to performe Penance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſtanding an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> In like manner is it of the Pardon of a Penance of ſeauen yeeres, in reſpect of the like Penance for fiue.</p>
               <p>Yet this muſt we aduertiſe euerie deuoute Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke: that he be not for reſpect of Indulgences, ſlack in performing his ordinary enioined penance: for that ordinary Penance w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is enioined is not only in ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which is paſt: but alſo for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for future harmes. And beeing enioined as an
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:7960:340"/> oppoſite thing vnto thoſe in which he ſinned, teach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth him howe to ouercome himſelfe, in his euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, &amp; to lay foundations of great &amp; ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler merits and vertues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Pardons are diuided in reſpect of the quantity of the Puniſhmentes deſerued. For ſome are full remiſſions, others are not full remiſſions.</p>
               <p>The full remiſſions are by ſome great Diuines very probablely ſaide to be of three ſortes.<note place="margin">Ful Pardons of diuerſe ſortes by ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</note> For they ſay that there is a Plenary, a more Large, &amp; a moſt full Indulgence. The firſt they wil haue to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the puniſhmente of thoſe ſinnes onlie which are confeſſed: The ſecond, of the puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to thoſe which are Confeſſed; &amp; beſides to all mortall ſinnes by forgetfulneſſe not Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: The third, they will haue to containe aboue theſe, the remiſſion of the puniſhment euen of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes: ſo that then there is nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be paide.</p>
               <p>Yet other great Diuines alſo do vnder the name of a Plenary comprehend all theſe:<note place="margin">A Plenary but of one ſorte.</note> affirming that a Plenary Indulgence taketh away all temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement for all ſinnes remitted. And conſidering that this matter doth depende of the intention of the diſpenſour of the treaſures of the Church: it ſeemeth that this ſecond opinion in our age, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with trueth: for that it ſeemeth that ſuch is now the generall meaning of that worde Plenary.</p>
               <p>Yet howſoeuer it be: certaine it is,<note place="margin">Iubiley, the moſt large of all.</note> that thoſe Indulgences which are called Iubileys, are the moſt Large. Both becauſe although the aforeſaide di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction were true; yet the Iubiley is in the higheſt degree; and for that, although we muſt reuerently
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:7960:341"/> thinke of all cauſes of Indulgences comming from our Superiours: yet there can bee no iuſter cauſe of Pardon, than that which is the motiue of the Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: which therefore is moſt ſafe and ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A iuſt and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cauſe alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note>For the better conceiuing of this point, we will heere aduertiſe the Reader, that in euery Indulgence there is required a iuſt and conuenient cauſe. For the gouernours of the Church are diſpenſers only of Gods myſteries,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 4, 2.</note> &amp; therefore it is a pointe of their fidelitie with iuſt cauſes and conuenient meanes to execute their office. Wherefore although it bee a generall Axiome of Diuines, that Indulgences are of ſuch value, as they ſound: yet this is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode,<note place="margin">Indulgentiae tantum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, quantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonant.</note> if the cauſe be proportionable. Otherwiſe although they doe ſomewhat profite, yet ſo much only as the proportion of the cauſe requireth. And ſo may it happen, that although a cauſe be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as ſufficient for a Plenary, or other Indulgence which is in deede proportionable,<note place="margin">A ſufficient cauſe, to ſome not ſufficient.</note> if it bee executed with great deuotion and feruour: yet may it bee ſo coldely doone of ſome particular perſons, that it arriueth not to the full obtaining of the Pardon, but only in ſome degree knowen to God alone.</p>
               <p>Hereof may it appeare why I ſaide the Iubiley to be the ſafeſt.<note place="margin">What is a Iubiley.</note> For the Iubiley was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in imitation of the Iubiley of the olde Lawe when a full releaſe of many rigorous difficulties of that law was made according to MOISES his preſcript. And this our obſeruation of certaine times wherein the people of God ſhould more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly attend vnto aſpirituall liberty,<note place="margin">Leuit. 25.</note> and a ſpeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vniting of the whole Church togither in that lincke of charity which Chriſt lefte vnto his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:7960:341"/> and moſt of all vnto a continuall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and concord with the ſucceſſours of Saint PETER: how neceſſary and profitable it hath bene: the experience of many yeeres doth euidently ſhew. This Iubiley had wont to be obſerued eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hundreth yeaer,<note place="margin">Yeere of Iubiley.</note> afterward for the ſhortnes of mans life was reduced to euery fiftith: and nowe is obſerued after euery fiue and twenty.</p>
               <p>But beſides this generall Iubiley,<note place="margin">Particuler Iubileis.</note> ſometimes there are particular Iubileys ſent forth for ſome ſingular greate neceſſitie of the Church: in which for that the neceſſity is vrgent, and great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne cauſes are enioined for the obteyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the wholle Church of Chriſt ouer all the worlde with one harte and one minde concurreth: no doubte can be made at all, but the cauſe is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and Chriſtes liberality is open vnto the world: by which that cauſe which of it ſelfe is great and ſufficient, through the merites and praiers of his ſpouſe, is alſo made aboundant to euery one which with meane zeale and feruour fulfilleth the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to our diuiſion of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">Indugences not Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> Thoſe Indulgences which are not full remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: are of diuerſe ſortes. ſome are indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: others, certaine and determinate. Of the firſt kinde are thoſe, which remitte ſome proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable parte of ſinnes: as the third parte, or ſuch other like. In the ſecond are thoſe comprehended,<note place="margin">The thirde part of ſins. Quarante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> which doe ſpeacifie a certaine number of daies; as 7. 10. a quarentene, that is of 40. daies: or of yeres; as of one, of 10 of 100. 1000. or as it ſhall pleaſe the giuer, according to the auncient cuſtome of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined

For if the ſeuere eſtimation of the Primitiue Church hath adiudged euery notable mortall ſinne to 7. yeeres Penance: then how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres Penance ſhould ſo many thoughtes, ſo many wordes, ſo many actions deſerue as are in this colde age of ours ſo little regarded?<note place="margin">It is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ſeeke many Pardons.</note> Wiſelye therefore doe they who neuer ceaſſe to procure theſe Chriſtian helpes of our frailty, not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them as ſmall, becauſe they are not Plenaries: For it may ſo happen that to one which oweth 4: yeeres onely of ſatisfaction: 7. yeeres may bee as good as a Plenary. Moreouer of Plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences none can be ſure; no, nor of any Indulgence at all: whereas they cannot be ſure of their eſtate of grace in the ſeeking of them, and if they be in grace: yet of any certaine determination of theire deſerts of temporal paine: they cannot haue know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge: neither of the full obtaining of ſo manye yeeres as are graunted of Pardon.

               <p>The true meaning therefore of theſe yeeres or daies is this:<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of yeeres and daies.</note> that looke how much of the paines of Purgatory we could redeeme with one yeers Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this world, ſuch as might by reaſon be inioined vs, our deuotion &amp; feruour and deſire of ſatisfying Gods Iuſtice<note n="*" place="margin">See page 640.</note> conſidered: ſo much now by the benignity and mercy of the Church is in one yeeres Indulgence releaſed: and ſo of other quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of yeeres &amp; daies.

               <p n="8">8 The right &amp; autority of Gods Church in giuing Pardons, is largely proued.</p>
               <p>A Learned &amp; famous Author, very wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto our aduerſaries; not vnworthily, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with a common faulte which hee calleth SCIOMACHIA, fightinge with a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe.

Wherefore leaſt this poore labour of mine, taken principally, and only for my deere Catholicke Brethren, or thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the way, would be glad to haue ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection vnto the trueth; might by any miſſefortune fall into the handes of ſome SHADOVVE-KIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER: I thought it expedient before I entered into any deepe demonſtration of this matter, firſt to ſet them down the ſimple trueth: which being doone, euen as it were by the very ſame Candel which firſt was ſhadowed by themſelues, nowe placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and their ſhadowe, the ſhadowe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, the quarell might without any blowes at all be peacablely finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Yet nowe will I as well for the ſimple Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes vnderſtanding, as for the better breaking of ſuch skittiſhe wittes, from finding bugges where there is no cauſe: make ſome farther conſideration of the trueth; ſhewing and prouing it out of holy Scriptures, &amp; continuall practiſe of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>But before we take this matter in hande: we muſt warne our aduerſaries, that here we doe not intend to diſpute whether there be any Temporall
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:7960:343"/> puniſhement after the remiſſion of the ſinnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Nowe therefore thus we will briefely conclude our purpoſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt hath lefte in his Church the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 16, 19.</note> Keies of the kingdome of Heauen, autority to<note n="(b)" place="margin">Io. 20, 22</note> remitte ſinnes, the<note n="(c)" place="margin">2.

               <p>Secondly S. PAVL in the<note n="*" place="margin">The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes falſely tranſlate in the ſight of Chriſt.</note> perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 2. Cor. 2, 10.</note> &amp; at the requeſt of the Corinthians, pardoneth the inceſtuous perſon, remitting him (as THEODO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RET expoundeth, and the wordes doe manifeſtly importe) part of his deſerued Penance: But what autoritie Chriſt gaue vnto S. PAVL: the ſame hath he lefte in his Church, vntill<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4, 13.</note> we meet al into the

Pardons are alwaies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the power of Chriſt. Io. 8, 11.</note> Therefore doth there nowe remaine in the Paſtours the ſame authoritie. See heere the very word of Pardoning: if the Heretickes haue not left it out, or altered it in their Bible. Where alſo is to be noted, that S. PAVL executed this leuity in the Perſon of Chriſt: and ſo doe our Paſtours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vſing this Phraſe: Mercifully in our Lorde we releaſe. Of which our Sauiour hath left vs ſundrie examples in diuerſe offendours, particularly in the aduoutreſſe, whoſe temporall puniſhment hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</p>

<pb n="659" facs="tcp:7960:344"/> in the Church before reconciliation by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly S. CYPRIAN in diuerſe epiſtles complaineth of thoſe which ouer-eaſely did giue peace vnto Penitents:<note place="margin">4 Lib. 1 ep. 3. &amp; lib 3 ep. 14. 18 &amp; ſer de lapſis.</note> for ſo he calleth that which we now call Pardons, and he writeth vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confeſſors of Chriſt then in Priſons, to requeſt them not to exceede herein. For thoſe which for ſome faultes were in the number of Penitents: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily had recourſe vnto thoſe which for Chriſtes ſake did ſuffer torments or impriſonment, and by their letters commended to their Biſhoppes, were for their ſakes releaſed. Of which cuſtome TER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVLLIAN alſo is a notable witneſſe: exhorting the Martyrs to peace amongſt themſelues,<note place="margin">in lib. ad Mart. deſig.</note> becauſe they obtained peace for many; which otherwiſe had not peace in the Church.</p>
               <p>Fifthly the Penitentiall Canons of the Church were made and decreed by the Church: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and by the ſame they haue bene releaſed as we haue ſhewed. But to releaſe the Puniſhments of this world and to leaue men with the debte of more bitter puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the other, were not to prouide carefully for the welfare of Chriſtes flocke: Therefore the continual practiſe of the Fathers hath bene in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Penances enioined, to remitte all the deſerte of chaſtiſement euen in the other worlde.</p>
               <p>But if one ſhoulde obiecte: that they did no more, then we are accuſtomed to doe, who when we enioine Penance leſſe then the deſerte, doe not withall pardon the wholle ſatisfaction: ſo doth it not ſeeme that theſe Fathers pardoned their Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, but onely were contented with a ſmall Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:7960:345"/> leauing the reſt to Gods iudgement and their deuotion This ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be any waies defended, for they wholly pardoned them, and gaue them Peace, and neuer charged them with any care or ſtudy of farther ſatisfaction: wherefore they much differed from our maner of Penance: who neuer enioine it as a ſufficient remedy, but as a neceſſary parte of the ſacrament, and a medicine for the time to come: hauing alſo regard in ſome parte to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Iuſtice of God ſtill leauing the parties perſwaded of their farther debte.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Penances now more eaſie, and Pardons more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then in times paſt.</note>Thus much be ſpoken of that feruent time of the Primitiue Church, when deuotion abounding neither ſinnes were ſo riſe, nor Penances ſo eaſie as now a daies And therefore in thoſe daies, were the Penances ſo greate and ſo long, that thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Fathers thought them ſufficient to make a full ſatisfaction vnto that which Gods iudgement had decreed vnto ſinnes remitted. Since which time the holy Church hath tenderly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the delicatenes of her children, leaſt they ſhould be<note n="*" place="margin">2.

For which reſpect, as ſhe is more milde in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Penances, not remitting but leauing the greateſt parte of the due correction to mens owne election: ſo is ſhe alſo more liberall at conuenient times, in imparting of the Treaſure of the Church to their releaſe &amp; pardon. not only remitting enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Penances, which would haue bene ſufficient in the new ſpring of the Church according to the courſe of thoſe daies: but alſo in a moſt large maner abſoluing from al maner of deſert of Puniſhment.</p>
               <pb n="661" facs="tcp:7960:345"/>
               <p>Now therefore hauing ſhewed moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this practiſe of the Church both in the Apoſtles time, and in the time of the Martyrs,<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaries Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons haue had.</note> and after them when a generall peace was giuen to the whole flock of Chriſt: ther cannot be any queſtion of the times following, this verity neuer being called into doubt before IHON WICLEFFE with his ſcholler IHON HVSSE and MARTIN LVTHER three perſons of eternall infamy, began to perturbe not only the peaceable gouernment of the Church, but alſo therewith, all true Chriſtian policy of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill common wealthes.

The one is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rigorous iuſtice, the other a iuſtice of condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. The firſt requireth a rigorous equality in the worke; and that, that which is offered vnto God, be of the offerers goods, not receiued of the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of him to whom it is offered. And ſuch iuſtice was in Chriſts Meritte and ſatisfaction vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vs: but in vs there can be nothing which we haue not liberally receiued of God: and therefore in this rigorous manner, we can neither meritte the leaſt grace in the worlde, nor ſatisfie for the leaſt idle worde.</p>
               <p>The ſecond requireth nothing elſe, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion of the worke which is offered, and beſides, the fauour &amp; acceptation of God, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe either of rewarde, or of releaſe of puniſhment:

Now hence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, that although we cannot bring any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, or for the paines of Hell due vnto them, ſo long as we bee either withered braunches, or altogither out of the vine: we may notwithſtanding vndoubtedly being quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the ſame liuely vine, and hauing the holy ghoſt within vs, perfectly doe the ſame for our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall debt.

And this ſecond ſuppoſition muſt alſo be vnderſtoode of thoſe which are Deade and in Purgatorie, For with them yet remaineh the ſame Communion. And thoſe which are aliue<note n="(e)" place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 29. 2. Mach. 12, 43. We may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the Deade</note> may be Baptiſed for them, as Saint PAVL ſaith:

Which will be ſomewhat for our purpoſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>And for the better vnderſtanding of this point, thou ſhalt vnderſtand good Reader, that our good workes way be in 3. ſortes beneficiall vnto vs from God. They may bee Meritorious, Satisfactorious, &amp; Impetratorious, that is, obtaining at Gods hands any good thing. They are Meritorious in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be doone in grace, for no good worke ſhall paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded: &amp; therefore euery particular good worke doone in Gods grace, deſerueth of Almighty God through his liberality and by the Merits of Chriſt, (which to one being in Gods fauor are vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated) both increaſe of grace, and ſuch degree of Gods glory in heauen, as is correſpondent to that grace. They are ſatisfactorious, in that they be laborious and painefull. For theſe are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte thinges in euery good worke: to proceede of grace and Charitie; and to be a painefull exerciſe. The one deſerueth a mutuall loue of God, vnto which is annexed a rewarde: the other maketh iuſt and equall paiment for a deſerued puniſhemente. And although there be three ſpeciall workes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Praier, Almes, &amp; Faſting, as hath beene ſaide; vnto which al other are reduced: yet whereas (as the Philſophers doe teacch) the obiecte of vertue is difficult for the corruptneſſe of our nature: there is no vertuous worke either inwarde, or outwarde, but beſides that it is Meritorious, it is alſo Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious. They are finally Impetratorious, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of God: in as much as they are either Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:7960:350"/> or any thing offered vnto God by way of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or demaunde. Which I adde for that any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorious worke may not onely be directed for the behalfe of another as it is Satisfactorious, but if it bee deuoutely offered for the obtaining of anie good thing for our Neighbour, it is alſo Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and a kinde of Praier. As if one ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or Faſt, to obtaine for his brother health, or any vertue. And this effecte of obtaining is founded in the liberality of our Sauior &amp; promiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we ſhal aske in his name he wil graunt vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe three thinges certaine it is that the firſt redoundeth onely to the good of him w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> w rketh.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 16, 15 Rom. 2, 6.</note> For all mercy ſhall make a place to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to the merite of his workes: no pure creature hauing this priuiledge to merite for any other: that being the priuiledge of Chriſt alone who hauing no neede of merite himſelfe for the glory of his owne ſoule, it being endowed with all wiſdome grace and glory euen from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his conception, deſerued grace and glory for vs al. Who therefore is compared vnto a Nurſe. For euery other perſon by his ordinary nutriment receiuing benefitte &amp; ſubſtance for himſelfe alone: the nurſe eateth for her ſelfe, and for her child. But the other two may effectually be donne for others, for as a man may pray for another: ſo may he alſo ſatisfie for another, if both be in grace: as we haue prooued,<note place="margin">Exod. 32, 32 Rom. 9, 3. Gen. 18, 33.</note> &amp; may be vnderſtood alſo by MOISES and S. PAVL, who deſired of God to ſatisfie for their peoples faulte: &amp; by thoſe iuſt, which if they had bene found in SODOME, ſhoulde haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the wholle Citie. Yet there is here to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:7960:350"/> that although thoſe which are in deadly ſinne be not wholly excluded from the communication of the meritts of the Church: this is onely in reſpect of her praiers in which they are included, and of a certaine kinde of meritte which the Diuines call DE CONGRVO of conueniency, farre inferiour to that which we ſpoke of, and of no certainty. But of this ſatisfaction by way of Iuſtice: they are no way partakers: becauſe they be deade members.</p>
               <p>Thirdly heereof doth followe that neceſſarily we muſt admitte ſome workes of Supererogation,<note place="margin">3 Workes of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. See pag. 410</note> which may be vnderſtoode of two ſorts. Firſt, thoſe are called workes of Supererogation, which belong to the Euangelicall Councells: of which enough hath beene ſaide before. Secondly, thoſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led workes of Supererogation, which although in reſpecte of Meritte, they be profitable to the perſon by which they bee wrought: yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Satisfaction which they haue in them, were not neceſſarie to the doers of them.

                     </gap>ation for ſinnes.</note>TO conclude this wholle Treatiſe of Indulgences, we may gather out of that which is ſaid: Firſt, that although a Pardon be principally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an abſolution from the debte of puniſhement; giuen by the vertue of the KEIES: Yet is it alſo a kind of compenſation withal. For the Prelate graunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pardon, doth ſo abſolue the Penitent, that he maketh out of the treaſure of the Chuch, an equall paimenr vnto Almighty God for the wholle debte:
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:7960:352"/> paying in the heade, &amp; in other members, that which ſhoulde without his ſacred autority haue beene paied by the partie himſelfe. Or thus more plainly, for the capacitie of the ſimpler ſorte: a Pardon is a mercifull releaſe in reſpecte of the Penitente: but in reſpecte of Gods iuſtice, an equall payment, made by the merits of others, applied for a recompence of the Penitent his ſinnes. And heerein we may ſee howe this abſolution differeth from the Sacramental abſolution in penance.<note place="margin">Howe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons differ from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance.</note> For there, is applied onely the Merits of Chriſt, &amp; not of his Saintes: whereas their merits coulde not reache vnto the taking away of the ſinnes themſelues, nor of the euerlaſting paine due vnto the ſame. But here the merittes alſo of the Saintes in as much as they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorious, doe take place. God hauing ſo diſpoſed, that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſweet gouernment of his Church, his members doe in the courſe of their iuſtification &amp; deliuery from all puniſhements, what they are able: they being able by the concourſe of his Spirite nowe dwelling within them to ſatisfie for temporall paine. Beſides, in Penance the wholle euerlaſting paine is taken away, but heere not alwaies the wholle tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall correction, but ſo much onely as it pleaſeth the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, according to the proportion of the cauſe. Finally the Sacramente is an inſtrument of Chriſtes eternall Prieſthoode, in which he himſelfe remitteth ſinnes by the inſtrumentary miniſtery of his prieſt: But in Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences the Prelate is properly the worker, by his auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity receiued from Chriſt: neither is it neceſſarie that he be a Prieſt or Biſhop, if he haue iuriſdiction: which may be in a Biſhop elected &amp; yet not conſecrated.</p>

                  </note> we inferre that onely Biſhoppes can giue Pardons to thoſe which are of theire Dioceſſe:
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:7960:353"/> and that not onely for the reſtrainte made by the Church: but alſo for the very nature and condition of Pardons. For although vnto all Prieſtes be ſaide whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer you forgiue they ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: yet is this authoritie alwaies vnderſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the neceſſarie regiment which Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in his Church. And therefore a Prieſt cannot by his Prieſthood alone abſolue, except he haue iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction alſo. Likewiſe an ordinarie Prieſt, although he be a Pariſh Prieſt, and haue cure of ſoules, cannot excommunicate: and yet that autoritie belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Keies of the Church. Theſe thinges therefore doe require ſuch ſoueraigne autoritie as is in the chiefe gouernours and Prelates of the Church: and eſpeaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly in this preſent caſe: where the common treaſure of the familie being diſpenſed, there muſt of neceſſitie be had the conſent of the ruler of the ſame, which is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Biſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3 Biſhoppes power in graunting Pardons, is iuſtly limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>Thirdely we may gather, that the POPE in limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Indulgences of Biſhops, hath not doone them any iniury at all. For the Biſhoppe hath not autoritie ouer the works of any which are not his ſubiects. And thoſe alſo being once dead belong no more to his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, than to another: and conſequently the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Merittes is out of his iuriſdiction. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his particular treaſure beeing ſo vncertaine (for it may ſo fall out that in his wholle Dioceſſe there may be very fewe ſuperfluous ſatisfactions) the POPE in limiting him hath prouided for all inconueniences, leaſt the Biſhop deceiue the people, in promiſing more than he may performe: which in ſacred matters is a pernitious thing. And moreouer, it is very probably to be thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the POPE hath allowed thoſe Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:7960:353"/> which Biſhops may giue, as out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Treaſure of the wholle Church, and ſo there can be no doubt of the value of them at al, nor any iniury in reſtraining the Biſhop, who is rather holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereby.</p>
               <p>Fourthly hence appeareth the reaſon,<note place="margin">4 None ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in deadlie ſinne.</note> why an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence cannot be receiued by him which is out of Grace. For Grace is neceſſarie to participate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefit of other mens Satisfactions. And the Indulgence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me onlie ſo much as my owne Satisfaction could doe: but my Satisfaction were nothing doone out of Gods fauour: therefore can the Indulgence heere auaile me nothing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly we may nowe vnderſtand what difference there is betweene the Satisfaction of others applied by the Church: and by one man vnto another.<note place="margin">5 He w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth for an other doth not graunt Indulgence</note> For he which applieth his own Satisfaction to another, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſurely knowe whether himſelfe be in Grace, and conſequently whether his Satisfaction be accepted of God: But theſe Satisfactions applied in Indulgences are moſt certaine. Beſides: another man applying his Satisfaction for my reliefe, doth not abſolue me from my debte of Satisfaction, but only payeth for me. Wherefore I am ſtill bound to fulfil my Penance, that beeing a meere perſonall worke to bee vndertaken by my ſelfe: But the contrary is in Indulgences as hath beene declared before. Laſt of al, after the worke is paſt, we cannot apply the Satisfaction of it vnto our neighbour: but it either helpeth our ſelues, or if it were not neceſſary for our ſelues, it goeth into the common treaſure: But the Church applieth the Satisfactions of workes which are paſt to our reliefe in Indulgence.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he which receiueth an Indulgence,<note place="margin">6 Publicke nance enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not alway take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by Pardon.</note> is bound notwithſtanding to fulfill all Penances which

And thoſe Penances are to Satisfie the worlde ſcandalized by our faultes, and to be a warning for others from committing the like.</p>

               <p n="11">11 Of Pardons for the Deade.</p>
               <p>FInally, wee hence inferre that Pardons may bee graunted vnto the Deade, who in the vnitie of CHRISTES body, haue departed this life: and that in as infallible a manner (if the cauſe bee ſufficient) as vnto thoſe which are aliue: yet not by waye of abſolution, but by waye of Suffrage, which we will forthwith expounde. For it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode:<note place="margin">See pag. 219 Three kind of Suffrages for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deade.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſoules departed out of this worlde, &amp; in Purgatorie ſuffering the chaſtiſement of God: may, as aboue hath bin ſhewed out of S.

Firſt, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Sacrifice of the MASSE: which is vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propitiatory for the quicke and the dead. Secondly, by the praiers of the Church, and of other deuoute Chriſtians. Thirdly by Almes, or any other Penall worke doone for them. And concerning the firſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:7960:354"/> it is not our owne worke, but the very worke of Chriſt himſelfe: we will not heere ſpeake thereof. The ſecond is founded as we ſaide before, in the meere li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of Chriſt, without any certaine promiſe. For although God infalliblely doth heare and graunt the Petition of one which is in grace, when he praieth for himſelfe,<note n="*" place="margin">D. Thom. 2.2. quaeſt. 83. artic. 15.</note> and for neceſſary things vnto ſaluation, &amp; with humility and perſeuerance: yet when he praieth for another, either aliue or dead, there is no ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and infallibility of obtaining. Becauſe we know not, whether, or howe farre God accepteth our praier, nor the diſpoſition of the other. The like is to be ſaid of that imperfecte kinde of Merit, which is called DE CONGRVO of Congruity or Conueniency: For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes one which is in grace meriteth for another man either aliue or dead, many good thinges: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe herein is no certaine Lawe or promiſe of God, or reaſon of Iuſtice betweeene him and vs: as there is in the other merit of condignity, which wee ſpake of before: there is no certainty but all lefte to the ſecret diſpoſition of God. But the third thing, which is to offer for them which are dead in Chriſt either Almes, or Faſting, or any other work of Satisfaction, yea, &amp; Praier, in as much as it is Satisfactorious, becauſe of the labour thereof: hath an infallible effecte, euen of iuſtice for to ſatisfie for their paines. Yet ſo that the offerer be in grace. The reaſon of this, is, that which we touched before, for that they be of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtes myſticall body: and in great neede of helpe: and therefore doe receiue the influence from the heade, as other members doe. And as there is an equality of Iuſtice in the ſatisfaction of one iuſt man offered for another beeing aliue: ſo alſo is there the
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:7960:355"/> ſame kind of iuſtice, in the ſame ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, offered for the dead.<note place="margin">Prayer is two waies profitable vnto the Deade.</note> Wherefore it is very profitable for him which praieth for the dead, not only to offer his praier to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mercie for him: but alſo to offer vnto God that very labour of praying for him. For in this reſpecte it is ſatisfactorious, &amp; hath an infallible effecte for him: in the other reſpecte it is impetratorious, and hath no certaine promiſed meaſure of benefite, but only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods meere liberality, the deuotion of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which praieth, and the eſtate of the party deceaſſed conſidered. Yet doe I not doubt but that alwaies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is alſo obtained, when the ſatisfaction is auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For it belongeth to Gods merciful liberality to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe where we by, his gratious permiſſion &amp; promiſe doe beſtow: ſo that it is very conuenient to thinke that if in ſuch praier the ſatisfaction be ſufficiently deriued to the deade by our application: God alſo by hearing the ſame Praier doth liberally graunt our requeſt in part, and adde ſomewhat to the value of our ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which we make for our Brother. Yet as the quantity is vncertaine ſo may it be much more, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the praier being feruent, than that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the certaine limited fruit of the ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Theſe helpes therfore which we may afforde vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules departed: are called the Suffrages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deade.</p>

               <p>For this is the wholle courſe of an Indulgence in this life. PETER oweth vnto Almightie God great
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:7960:355"/> Penance: and becauſe men which are aliue may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye their ſatisfactions for PETERS reliefe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may the POPE out of the Treaſure of the wholle Church yeelde vnto PETER conuenient reliefe: of which infallibly PETER ſhall be partaker if he be in grace: and a recompence of iuſtice is made vnto God for PETERS debte. Euen ſo is it in the deade: who for that they may be partakers of common Suffrages of the Church: may by Indulgences receiue a perfect ſupply of that which by the ſuffrages they may receiue.</p>
               <p>This doe the Diuines call,<note place="margin">Per modu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Suffragij.</note> and it is ſo alſo called in the ordinary Pardons, By way of Suffrage: that is, not as ſome doe miſſe vnderſtand it: as if the meaning of ſuch a Pardon were, if they can obtaine it of God, they ſhall deliuer a Soule out of Purgatory: for then the Pardon could not be of certaine force for the dead: But the ſenſe is: they ſhall deliuer a Soule out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: euen as if they had donne ſo much of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Suffrages for them, as were ſufficient for the wholle effect of the Indulgence. This ſhall be more cleere if we conſider, the cauſe of this maner of ſpeach, which was this. To thoſe which liue in this world: Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences are not onely recompences made to God for our debte: but alſo a proper abſolution: The POPE abſoluing vs, and paying that which wee owe out of the Treaſure. Nowe the POPE hauing no auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or iuriſdiction ouer the deade, he cannot abſolue them: yet as he may and all other Chriſtians may by common Suffrages yeelde them conuenient helpe: ſo may he ſupply ſuch helpe by applying out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that which may be auaileable vnto them.</p>
               <p>And therefore although he doth not abſolue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as not being their iudge: yet he applieth to their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
